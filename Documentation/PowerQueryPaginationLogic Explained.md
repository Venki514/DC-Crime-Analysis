## Power Query M Code Explained (Detailed Walkthrough)

This section provides an in-depth explanation of the Power Query M code used to fetch, combine, and transform the DC Crime Incident data from the API source. It covers not just *what* each function does, but *why* it's used in this specific context and how the data flows through the process.

### Part 1: Setup and Configuration

```m
let
    // --- Parameters for Pagination ---
    BaseUrl = "https://maps2.dcgis.dc.gov/dcgis/rest/services/FEEDS/MPD/MapServer/6/query",
    PageSize = 1000,
    BaseQuery = [
        where = "1=1",
        outFields = "*",
        f = "geojson",
        outSR = "4326"
    ],
```

*   **Context:** This initial block defines static parameters that control the data fetching process.
*   **`BaseUrl` (Text):** Stores the fundamental URL of the API endpoint *before* any specific query parameters are added. This makes it easy to update if the service location changes.
*   **`PageSize` (Number):** Critically set to `1000`, matching the `MaxRecordCount` discovered for this specific API layer. Using the correct `MaxRecordCount` minimizes the number of API calls needed. Requesting more than this limit wouldn't return more records per page.
*   **`BaseQuery` (Record):** Holds the standard query parameters required by the API for *any* request for this data (aside from pagination controls).
    *   `where = "1=1"`: A common SQL-like clause meaning "return all records" (no filtering based on attributes at this stage).
    *   `outFields = "*"`: Requests all available data fields (properties) for each feature.
    *   `f = "geojson"`: Specifies the desired output format *from the API*. GeoJSON is chosen as it's a standard, structured format suitable for geographic features and their attributes.
    *   `outSR = "4326"`: Requests the coordinate data (Latitude/Longitude) to be returned in the WGS84 spatial reference system, which is the standard for GeoJSON and widely used in web mapping and tools like Power BI.
*   **Why Use Parameters:** Isolating these values makes the query more readable and maintainable compared to hardcoding them directly into the `Web.Contents` calls later.

### Part 2: The `FetchPage` Helper Function

```m
    // --- Function to Fetch a Single Page ---
    FetchPage = (offset as number) as record =>
        let
            // ... function body ...
        in
            JsonResult,
```

*   **Context:** This defines a reusable custom function *within* the main query. Its sole purpose is to retrieve a single page of data given a starting record number (`offset`). This modular approach cleans up the main pagination logic.
*   **`(offset as number) as record`**: Defines the function signature. It takes one parameter, `offset` (explicitly typed as a number), and is declared to return a `record` (which will be the parsed JSON response or `null` on error).

```m
            PageQuery = BaseQuery & [
                resultOffset = Text.From(offset),
                resultRecordCount = Text.From(PageSize)
            ],
```

*   **Inside `FetchPage`:** This dynamically constructs the *full* set of query parameters for the *specific page* being requested.
*   **`BaseQuery & [...]`**: The `&` operator merges two records. It takes the static `BaseQuery` record and merges it with a new record containing the *pagination* parameters for this specific call.
*   **`resultOffset = Text.From(offset)`**: Specifies which record number to start retrieving from (0 for the first page, 1000 for the second, etc.). `Text.From` is essential as URL query parameters must be text.
*   **`resultRecordCount = Text.From(PageSize)`**: Tells the API the maximum number of records to return in this single request (set to 1000 via `PageSize`). Again, `Text.From` ensures it's passed as text.

```m
            RawResponse = try Web.Contents(BaseUrl, [Query = PageQuery]),
```

*   **Inside `FetchPage`:** This is the core API call for the page.
*   **`Web.Contents(BaseUrl, [Query = PageQuery])`**: Makes the HTTP GET request. It sends the `BaseUrl` and appends the combined parameters from `PageQuery` as URL query parameters (e.g., `...?where=1=1&f=geojson&resultOffset=1000&resultRecordCount=1000`).
*   **`try ...`**: This crucial error handling mechanism attempts the `Web.Contents` operation. If the API call fails (network issue, server error like 500, timeout, invalid request), the `try` expression *captures* the error instead of halting the entire Power BI refresh. The result stored in `RawResponse` will be a record indicating success or failure.

```m
            JsonResult = if RawResponse[HasError] then null else Json.Document(RawResponse[Value])
```

*   **Inside `FetchPage`:** This processes the result of the `try Web.Contents`.
*   **`if RawResponse[HasError] then null ...`**: Checks the special `[HasError]` field within the record returned by `try`. If `true`, it means the API call failed for this page. In this case, the function returns `null` to signal this failure to the calling `List.Generate` logic. Returning `null` is a simple way to handle the error within the pagination loop. More sophisticated error logging or retry logic could be added but increases complexity.
*   **`... else Json.Document(RawResponse[Value])`**: If `HasError` is `false`, the API call was successful. `RawResponse[Value]` contains the raw binary response body (the GeoJSON text). `Json.Document` parses this text into a structured Power Query record, making the features, properties, etc., accessible.

### Part 3: The `List.Generate` Pagination Engine

```m
    // --- Generate List of Pages using List.Generate ---
    ListOfFeaturePages = List.Generate(
        // 1. Initial Value Function
        () => [PageResult = FetchPage(0), Offset = 0],

        // 2. Condition Function
        (Previous) => Previous[PageResult] <> null and List.Count(Previous[PageResult][features]?) > 0,

        // 3. Next Value Function
        (Previous) =>
            let
                NextOffset = Previous[Offset] + List.Count(Previous[PageResult][features]),
                NextPageResult = FetchPage(NextOffset)
            in
                [PageResult = NextPageResult, Offset = NextOffset],

        // 4. Selector Function (Optional)
        (Current) => Current[PageResult][features]?
    ),
```

*   **Context:** This is the most complex but powerful part, orchestrating the iterative fetching of all pages. It constructs a list (`ListOfFeaturePages`) where each item *should* be the list of `features` from a single API response page.
*   **1. Initial Value Function `() => [PageResult = FetchPage(0), Offset = 0]`**:
    *   Defines the starting state for the iteration. It calls `FetchPage` for the very first page (`offset = 0`).
    *   It returns a *record* containing two fields: `PageResult` (the parsed JSON or `null` from the first fetch) and `Offset` (the offset *used* for that fetch, which was 0). This record represents the "state" at the beginning of the loop.
*   **2. Condition Function `(Previous) => Previous[PageResult] <> null and List.Count(Previous[PageResult][features]?) > 0`**:
    *   Determines whether the loop should continue *for another iteration*. It receives the *state record* from the *previous* iteration (`Previous`).
    *   `Previous[PageResult] <> null`: Checks if the *previous* API call (whose result is stored in `Previous[PageResult]`) was successful. If a page fetch failed, we stop.
    *   `List.Count(Previous[PageResult][features]?) > 0`: Checks if the *previous* successful API call actually returned any features. The API signals the end of the data by returning a valid response but with an empty `features` list. The `?` (safe navigation) handles cases where `features` might be missing in an unexpected (but valid) JSON response or if `PageResult` was null (though the first condition should catch that).
    *   The `and` means *both* conditions must be true to continue fetching.
*   **3. Next Value Function `(Previous) => ...`**:
    *   Calculates the "state" for the *next* iteration, again receiving the `Previous` state record.
    *   `NextOffset = Previous[Offset] + List.Count(Previous[PageResult][features])`: This is the core offset calculation. It takes the offset used in the *previous* step (`Previous[Offset]`) and adds the number of records *successfully retrieved* in that previous step (`List.Count(...)`). This correctly determines the starting record number for the *next* page. (Note: Using `?` isn't strictly necessary here because the `Condition` function should have already ensured `PageResult` and `features` were valid if we got this far, but it doesn't hurt).
    *   `NextPageResult = FetchPage(NextOffset)`: Calls the helper function to fetch the *next* page using the newly calculated offset.
    *   `in [PageResult = NextPageResult, Offset = NextOffset]`: Returns the *new state record* containing the result of *this* page fetch and the offset *used* for it. This new record becomes the `Previous` record for the *subsequent* iteration's Condition and Next functions.
*   **4. Selector Function `(Current) => Current[PageResult][features]?`**:
    *   This optional function determines what value is actually added to the output list (`ListOfFeaturePages`) for each iteration *that passed the condition*.
    *   It receives the *current* state record (`Current`).
    *   It extracts just the list of `features` from the `PageResult` for that iteration. The `?` provides safety in case `features` is unexpectedly missing. If `PageResult` itself was null (due to an error), this selector would likely also result in `null` being added to the list for that iteration (which `List.Select` handles next).

### Part 4: Aggregating and Structuring the Results

```m
    // --- Combine Features from All Pages ---
    CombinedFeatures = List.Combine(List.Select(ListOfFeaturePages, each _ <> null)),

    // --- Create a Source Record similar to the original query ---
    Source = [features = CombinedFeatures],

    // --- PASTE YOUR ORIGINAL TRANSFORMATION STEPS BELOW ---
    ExtractFeatures = Source[features], // This now uses the combined list
```

*   **`List.Select(ListOfFeaturePages, each _ <> null)`**: Filters the `ListOfFeaturePages` created by `List.Generate`. `each _ <> null` is a concise way to define a function that checks if the current item (`_`) in the list is not equal to `null`. This step is crucial to remove any `null` placeholders that might exist in `ListOfFeaturePages` due to API errors during the fetching of specific pages (as handled by the `try...if` in `FetchPage`).
*   **`List.Combine(...)`**: Takes the filtered list (which now contains only *lists* of features) and flattens it into a single, long list containing *all* features from *all* successfully fetched pages. This is the complete, raw dataset of features.
*   **`Source = [features = CombinedFeatures]`**: This clever step creates a simple record that mimics the structure of the JSON document returned by a *single* API call (`Json.Document` originally created `[features = ..., type = ...]`). By creating `[features = CombinedFeatures]`, the *rest* of your original script, starting with `ExtractFeatures = Source[features]`, can run *unmodified* because it expects to find the list of features inside a record accessible via the `Source` variable and the `features` key.

### Part 5: Standard Data Transformations (Post-Pagination)

This part of the script applies standard Power Query transformations to the combined list of features, now that all data is available in memory.

*   **`Table.FromList(ExtractFeatures, ...)`**: Converts the unified list of feature *records* into a table. Each row represents a feature, starting with a single column containing the feature record.
*   **`Table.ExpandRecordColumn(... "Column1", {"type", "id", "geometry", "properties"}, ...)`**: Expands the top-level feature record, bringing out `type`, `id`, `geometry`, and `properties` into separate columns.
*   **`Table.SelectColumns(..., {"properties"})`**: Focuses subsequent steps primarily on the `properties` column, which contains the actual crime incident attributes (like `CCN`, `OFFENSE`, etc.). The raw geometry column is often less useful directly in Power BI tables unless specific spatial processing is done, and the Lat/Lon are usually available within `properties` anyway.
*   **`Table.ExpandRecordColumn(..., "properties", {"CCN", "REPORT_DAT", ...}, ...)`**: This is a **key step**. It expands the `properties` record, transforming each key-value pair within `properties` into a distinct column in the table (e.g., `CCN`, `REPORT_DAT`, `OFFENSE`, `WARD`). This creates the main tabular structure. *Specifying the list of column names explicitly is good practice for robustness.*
*   **`Table.TransformColumnTypes(...)`**: **Crucial** for Power BI. Assigns the correct data type to each column (`Int64.Type` for nullable whole numbers, `type number` for decimals, `type text`, `type date`, `type time`, etc.). Correct types are essential for:
    *   Accurate calculations and aggregations.
    *   Proper functioning of slicers and filters.
    *   Building relationships in the data model.
    *   Performance optimizations within the Power BI engine.
*   **`Table.SelectRows(..., each ([START_DATE] <> null) and ([END_DATE] <> null))`**: Filters out rows where the original epoch values for start/end dates are missing. This acts as a data quality step, ensuring that records used for time-based analysis have the necessary base information *before* attempting potentially error-prone date conversions.
*   **`Table.AddColumn(...)` [for DateTime Conversion]**: Creates new `datetime` columns (`REPORT_DATETIME`, etc.) from the Epoch millisecond columns. The formula `#datetime(1970,1,1,0,0,0) + #duration(0,0,0, Number.RoundDown([EPOCH_COL] / 1000))` is the standard M method: start at the Unix epoch origin and add the duration calculated from the epoch value (converting ms to seconds).
*   **`Table.AddColumn(...)` [for Date/Time Parts]**: Extracts user-friendly `Date` and `Time` components using `Date.From` and `Time.From`. This simplifies filtering, grouping, and creating date/time dimensions in the Power BI model.
*   **`Table.AddColumn(...)` [for `NEAREST_15M_TIME`]**: Creates a time slot column. The logic `Number.Round(Time.Minute(t) / 15) * 15` groups minutes into 15-minute intervals (0, 15, 30, 45). The `if m = 60 then #time(...) else ...` handles the edge case where rounding minute 53+ results in 60, correctly rolling over to the next hour with 0 minutes. This is useful for time-of-day pattern analysis less granular than the exact minute.
*   **`Table.RemoveColumns(...)`**: Cleans up the final table by removing columns that were intermediate steps (like the original epoch columns, the combined DateTime columns) or deemed unnecessary (`OCTO_RECORD_ID`), leaving only the final desired set of columns for the data model.

### Conclusion & Context

This Power Query script demonstrates a robust method for handling API pagination entirely within Power BI. It fetches all necessary data, combines it, and then applies standard transformations to prepare it for analysis and visualization. While the `List.Generate` part is complex, it provides a powerful, self-contained solution for APIs with record limits. The subsequent steps are standard data shaping practices crucial for building an effective and accurate Power BI report. Keep in mind that fetching large datasets this way can impact refresh times as it happens sequentially page by page.
